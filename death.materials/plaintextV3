"the sand in between" by tanvi.

Release along with interpreter.

Include Simple Chat by Mark Tilford.
Include Epistemology by Eric Eve.  


When play begins, say "It is late autumn. You feel a cool breeze carress your face. A chill crawls up your spine, you feel the boundaries between the living and the supernatural blurring.  You open your eyes, and they are greeted with light and salt.   An amorphous figure stands before you.  [line break] On this day, you died.[line break]"


The beach is a room. The description of the beach is "The beach stretches out as far as the eye can see. The sand is a glistening golden and sticks to your toes. The water is a perfect but disturbing cerulean blue. ".

Before printing the name of the beach: omit contents in listing.

A person can be satisfied or confused.

Dream is a person in the beach. The description of Dream is "[if confused] Dream is looking at you, pensively. They seem to be waiting for you to engage with them. [else] Dream seems to be slowly disappearing." Dream is confused.

[List of objects] 

The boat is a enterable container in the beach. The boat is fixed in place. The description of the boat is "Wooden, and stained a deep brown — the boat looks rickety and uninviting. It seems dream doesn't take care of this boat. Is he disgruntled by his working conditions?".


The red string is a undescribed thing in the beach. Understand "thread" as red string. The description of the thread is "long and wiry, it seems to have an ethereal glossy texture." 


The sand is scenery in the beach. The description of the sand is "The sand is continously shifting. You can't seem to focus on it, it slips away and dances around your feet. Hints of red seem to be buried in between. It weaves through the sand — long and thin — like a thread. "

Before showing something to Dream:
	if the noun is the red string:

		stop the action;
	otherwise:
		say "'What's your point, exactly?', asks Dream.";
		stop the action.

Instead of giving red string to Dream:
	say " [italic type] 'WHAT! Where did you get that? You can touch the string of fate? Its surprising you can see through algorithm that binds you. You really do wish to remain tethered. I'll take your string ', says Dream.";
	now Dream is holding red string.
	
[For some reason, Inform doesn't want me to end the story while in a dialogue, so I have to end it outside.]
	


Every turn:
	if Dream is holding red string:
		end the story saying "[roman type] You move on to the next life. Hopefully Dream will give you what was promised."
